# RGBD_Localization
## How to run the script
- I suggest using Linux as your operating system.
- Clone this repo.
- Download the dataset from [here](https://vision.in.tum.de/rgbd/dataset/freiburg1/rgbd_dataset_freiburg1_xyz.tgz).[[1]](#1)
- Place the rgb and depth folders where the repo is cloned.
- Use the following command to install the requirements.
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run the rgbd_localization.py

## How it works

- By a frequency determined by ```img_freq```, 2 images are compared at each iteration.
- SIFT [[2]](#2) is used to find key points in the 2 images.
- Inliers are determined by finding Homography between matched pixel coordinates using the Least-Median robust method (LMEDS).
- Then, by using the depth images, 3D points of the matched inliers are generated.
- The rotation and translation matrices are found by the method suggested in [[3]](#3) from the 3D coordinates.
- By knowing the first ground truth positions and the relative orientation between every 2 frames, the trajectory is estimated

## Expected results

These figures show the estimated and real trajectories in x, y, and z coordinates.

## Next Steps

- Quantifying the error of the estimated trajectory.
- Improving the accuracy by methods such as sensor fusion or AI approaches.
